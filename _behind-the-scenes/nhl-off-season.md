      In August of 2017 I was the Creative Director of Perfect Skating, a hockey
      development company that works with NHL players from around the world.
      Their founder, Shawn Allard, asked me to meet up with him in Switzerland
      to document his travels and work as he trained players in Switzerland,
      Sweden, and then across the United States. It was a bit of a last minute
      decision and the itinerary of the trip was still being worked out as I was
      jumping between trains and flights to get from Ottawa, ON to Bern,
      Switzerland.
