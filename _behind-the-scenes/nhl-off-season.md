      In August of 2017 I was the Creative Director of Perfect Skating, a hockey
      development company that works with NHL players from around the world.
      Their founder, Shawn Allard, asked me to meet up with him in Switzerland
      to document his travels and work as he trained players in Switzerland,
      Sweden, and then across the United States. It was a bit of a last minute
      decision and the itinerary of the trip was still being worked out as I was
      jumping between trains and flights to get from Ottawa, ON to Bern,
      Switzerland.

      All I really knew was that I would need to be able to film on the ice,
      record podcasts, take pictures, and be ready for any impromptu adventures
      Shawn decided to go on to get extra content while he had me around. Those
      adventures, as far as I knew from what he had floated, ranged from
      altitude training in the Swiss Alps and Colorado Rockies, to the desert of
      California or fishing in Wisconsin.


      Given I could only bring carry on luggage, I used my clothing to wrap
      cameras, drone, audio gear, and fit it all in a single backpack. I put my
      skates, extra clothing, footwear, and computer in a small suitcase. By the
      end of the trip I had mastered packing it all up given that at almost
      every airport security line I had to pull it all out to have it inspected.
      Apparently you can actually bring sharp skates in your carry on, who knew?

      After a 26 hour journey starting in Ottawa including four trains, two
      flights, and a bus through a tiny German town, I met up with Shawn in the
      capital of Switzerland (Bern). I had been on the ice once or twice before
      with NHL players, but not quite like this. In Bern I had full access. All
      the guys Shawn was training knew I was coming and were pretty easy going
      about me being around.


      The first session or two I was a little more cautious, but as I got to
      know the athletes in a given city, I was able to get a bit more creative.
      I have always been a pretty good skater myself, so the challenge of trying
      to keep up and get interesting shots while skating at full speed was a lot
      of fun for me.
