      In 2017 I was working as the Creative Lead for a company called Perfect Skating. The founder of the company, Shawn Allard, is a former professional hockey player and now works with NHL/Pro athletes around the world on their skating/performance.

      I met up with Shawn in Switzerland in August 2017 to join him on his travels for 12 days, going from Switzerland, to Sweden, to Los Angeles, to Colorado, to Wisconsin, and then finally home to Ottawa. In all I passed through 12 airports in 12 days, as well as numerous trains. I had to fit my filming, photo, and audio gear, as well as skates, clothing, footwear, etc… all into carry on luggage. The travel schedule was very tight and I couldn’t afford to have anything get delayed in checked luggage. Along the way I’d be documenting Shawns work with various athletes, filming on the ice, recording podcasts, etc…

      Having grown up a hockey fan, I was quite excited to get a peek into the NHL world, as well as the chance to travel around Europe!
