      In August of 2017 I was the Creative Director of Perfect Skating, a hockey
      development company that works with NHL players from around the world.
      Their founder, Shawn Allard, asked me to meet up with him in Switzerland
      to document his travels and work as he trained players in Switzerland,
      Sweden, and then across the United States. It was a bit of a last minute
      decision and the itinerary of the trip was still being worked out as I was
      hopping between trains and flights to get from Ottawa, ON to Bern,
      Switzerland. 


      Without a lot of details, I did my best to guess what I would need and fit
      all my gear and clothing into carry on luggage knowing I wouldn't have
      time to check luggage along the way.  Who knew you could bring sharp
      hockey skates in your carry on?

      I had to fit my filming, photo, and audio gear, as well as skates,
      clothing, footwear, etc… all into carry on luggage. The travel schedule
      was very tight and I couldn’t afford to have anything get delayed in
      checked luggage. Along the way I’d be documenting Shawns work with various
      athletes, filming on the ice, recording podcasts, etc…

      Having grown up a hockey fan, I was quite excited to get a peek into the
      NHL world, as well as the chance to travel around Europe!
