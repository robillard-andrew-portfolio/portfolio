      In August of 2017 I was the Creative Director of Perfect Skating, a hockey
      development company that works with NHL players from around the world.
      Their founder, Shawn Allard, asked me to meet up with him in Switzerland
      to document his travels and work as he trained players in Switzerland,
      Sweden, and then across the United States. It was a bit of a last minute
      decision and the itinerary of the trip was still being worked out as I was
      jumping between trains and flights to get from Ottawa, ON to Bern,
      Switzerland.

      All I really knew was that I would need to be able to film on the ice,
      record podcasts, take pictures, and be ready for any impromptu adventures
      Shawn decided to go on to get extra content while he had me around. The
      goal was for me to get as much content as possible to use as marketing
      material for Perfect Skating. This included having clothing for the top of
      the Swiss Alps, as well as the desert of California. 


      Given I could only bring carry on luggage, I used my clothing to wrap
      cameras, audio gear, and my drone to fit it all in a single backpack. I
      put my skates, extra clothing, footwear, and computer in a small suitcase.
      By the end of the trip I had mastered packing it all up given that at
      almost every airport security line I had to pull it all out to have it
      inspected.

      Having grown up a hockey fan, I was quite excited to get a peek into the
      NHL world, as well as the chance to travel around Europe!
