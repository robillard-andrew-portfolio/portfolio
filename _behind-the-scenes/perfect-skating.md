      In 2017 I was the Creative Director of Perfect Skating, a hockey
      development company that works with NHL hockey players from around the
      world. It was founded by Shawn Allard, a former professional hockey player
      himself, who is the current performance/skills coach of the Colorado
      Avalanche.


      In August of 2017, Shawn was working with some players in Switzerland. He
      asked me to meet him there so that I could follow and document his work
      for the next 12 days as he did the same in northern Sweden, then across to
      California, Colorado, and Wisconsin before returning home to Ottawa.

      I had to fit my filming, photo, and audio gear, as well as skates,
      clothing, footwear, etc… all into carry on luggage. The travel schedule
      was very tight and I couldn’t afford to have anything get delayed in
      checked luggage. Along the way I’d be documenting Shawns work with various
      athletes, filming on the ice, recording podcasts, etc…

      Having grown up a hockey fan, I was quite excited to get a peek into the
      NHL world, as well as the chance to travel around Europe!
