      "Shot In The Dark" is a live music series based out of Ottawa, ON. When
      the producers wanted to revamp the series for a second season, I was
      brought on board to over see the look of the project. I operated the main
      camera, was in charge of lighting, and oversaw the post-production process
      working along side Jeff Watkins, who was one of the producers, camera
      operators, and the main editor. 


      We had a venue booked for the day and had eight different bands each
      perform a single song three times, so they could choose their best
      performance for us to edit. It was a long day but it went fairly well
      considering the tight timeline.
