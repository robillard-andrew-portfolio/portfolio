      "Shot In The Dark" is a live music series based out of Ottawa, ON. When
      the producers wanted to revamp the series for a second season, I was
      brought on board to over see the look of the project. I operated the main
      camera, was in charge of lighting, and oversaw the post-production process
      working along side Jeff Watkins, who was one of the producers, camera
      operators, and the main editor. 


      We had a venue booked for the day and had eight different bands each
      perform a single song three times, so they could choose their best
      performance for us to edit.

      The idea behind Shot in the Dark is to have the bands each play but then
      also hang out to watch each others performances. So the audience is mainly
      made up of the other bands and crew. The venue we had partnered with was a
      live music venue, but we setup on the floor instead of the stage, so that
      we could shoot from all sides. 


      We made the decision not to try and hide lights, or other camera
      operators. We wanted everyone and everything involved to be part of the
      final video where possible.
