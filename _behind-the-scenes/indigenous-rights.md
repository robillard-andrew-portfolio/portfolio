    title: Digital Storytelling

      In 2013, while still in the early days of the production company I
      co-founded (Stuffed Motion), we had the honour of working with the Native
      Women's Association of Canada. They were looking to produce a series of
      videos telling the stories of Indigenous families who had a missing or
      murdered relative. The job required bringing all of our filming and
      editing gear to a hotel in Ottawa, where families from around Canada were
      staying for the duration of the project. Each day we would meet with
      families and elders, and when a family was feeling comfortable, they would
      sit down with us and tell their story.


      It was an incredibly delicate project to be a part of, and it was
      devastating to hear what these families had gone through. It was a
      different approach than anything I had worked on before because the focus
      was not on how good we could make it look, but instead was on making sure
      the families felt comfortable telling their stories. This meant filming
      when they were comfortable, including whatever imagery, blankets, photos,
      masks, etc... that they felt were important to representing their missing
      loved one. They sat next to us as we edited their stories, scanning in old
      photos, making sure we did their story justice. 


      I felt incredibly honoured to sit with them, listening to their elders
      talk about living through the residential school era, and couldn't believe
      the strength and humour with which they handled the intensity of the week.

      last thing you want is a client over your shoulder while you edit, but in
      this case, that was the whole point. It was the families story to tell and
      so they sat with us and we worked on it together. As we worked through the
      edit the families would tell us more about their loved ones. We'd scan in
      old photos and take pictures of cherished items to include in the video. 


      I felt incredibly honoured to sit with them each day, smudging and
      listening to their elders talk about living through the residential school
      era. You wouldn't believe the strength and humour with which they handled
      the intensity of the week.

    title: Creating PSA's

      After the digital story telling project was complete, we went on to do
      other work with NWAC. 


      Human trafficking disproportionately effects Indigenous communities, and
      so NWAC was looking to create a variety of PSA's on the issue. We worked
      along side young Indigenous women working and volunteering for NWAC to
      come up with effective ways to deliver that message, all on a pretty small
      budget. 


      While I wish I was still able to work with the organization, they
      understandably put a priority on hiring Indigenous videographers whenever
      possible. At the time we first signed our contract with them, they were
      unable to find a local Indigenous company, but once our original 2 year
      contract expired, they were able to find a local company to take over.




      They continue to do important work which you can see at [www.nwac.ca
