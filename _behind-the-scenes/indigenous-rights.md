      In 2013 I had the honour of working with the Native Women's Association of
      Canada. They were looking to produce a series of videos telling the
      stories of Indigenous families who had a missing or murdered relative. The
      job required bringing all of our filming and editing gear to a hotel in
      Ottawa, where families from around Canada were staying for the duration of
      the project. Each day we would meet with families and elders, and when a
      family was feeling comfortable, they would sit down with us and tell their
      story.


      It was an incredibly delicate project to be a part of, and it was
      devastating to hear what these families had gone through. I felt
      incredibly honoured to sit with them, listening to their elders talk about
      living through the residential school era, and couldn't believe the
      strength and humour with which they handled the intensity of the week.
