      For as long as I can remember, my family and extended family friends have
      been involved in a variety of summer camps. Specifically, summer camps
      with a focus on positive change in the world. 


      For many years I worked as a counsellor at Camp Ozanam, a summer camp for
      boys from the Toronto Area who might not otherwise have a chance to get
      out of the city and enjoy a camp setting. My family has also help to run
      Camp Micah in it's various forms, a peace and social justice camp that
      helps to empower high school youth to make a change in their community.

      Getting out of the city, spending time in the summer out in the woods, or
      by a lake, is something that has always been important to me. It's a
      privilege that not everyone has access to and so the work of places like
      Camp Ozanam to help share that experience with more and more people is
      really important.


      Once I was no longer able to dedicate full summers to working up at camp,
      I went up to visit for a weekend and brought all my camera gear. Ive
      always wanted to try and show people what camp is all about, and figured
      that having a way to tell that story would help the camp with it's
      fundraising efforts as well, given it is funded through charity.
