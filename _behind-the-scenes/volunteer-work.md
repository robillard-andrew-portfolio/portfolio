      For as long as I can remember, my family and extended family friends have
      been involved in a variety of summer camps. Specifically, summer camps
      with a focus on positive change in the world. 


      For many years I worked as a counsellor at Camp Ozanam, a summer camp for
      boys from the Toronto Area who might not otherwise have a chance to get
      out of the city and enjoy a camp setting. My family has also help to run
      Camp Micah in it's various forms, a peace and social justice camp that
      helps to empower high school youth to make a change in their community.
