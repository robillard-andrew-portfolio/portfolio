    I am a cinematographer, editor, and musician from Ottawa, Canada. I’ve been
    creating videos for the past decade and am more excited than ever to be
    doing so.


    I consider myself pretty easy going, and I think that making videos should
    be enjoyable for everyone involved. If that makes sense to you then let’s
    talk about your ideas!
