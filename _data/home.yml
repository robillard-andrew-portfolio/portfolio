    I am a cinematographer, editor, and musician from Ottawa, Canada. I’ve been
    creating videos for the past decade and am more excited than ever to be
    doing so.


    I consider myself pretty easy going, and I think that making videos should
    be enjoyable for everyone involved. If that makes sense to you then let’s
    talk about your ideas!

    Covid-19 may have us socially distant, but that doesn't mean we can't still
    create interesting content! Whether through existing footage, motion
    graphics or animation, where there is a will there's a way. \

    **If budget is an issue during these uncertain times,** please don't
    hesitate to let me know as I am happy to find a solution that works for both
    of us.
